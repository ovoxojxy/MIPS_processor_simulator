# MIPS_processor_simulator
The point of this project is to write the core part of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM using the C programming language on a Unix platform. Your MySPIM will demonstrate functions of the MIPS processor as well as the principle actions of the datapath and the control signals of a MIPS processor.
