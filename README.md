Hi! 
This is the Github Repo for CDA group 26. 😄

All given files for this assignment are already included in this repo.

❗❗
Remember! We are not allowed to edit spimcore.c and spimcore.h. **All work should be done on project.c**
❗❗

Please read through the spimcore.c file closely, especially the **Step()** function to understand how functions will be called and implemented.

All of the functions we have to complete are listed in the _Issues_ tab in this repo!
When you complete a function, please make sure to mark that function as completed ✔️ in the Issues tab so everyone is up to date.

Also, please make sure to **commit** all of your changes when working on github. Even if your function isn't complete/done, committing all progress is very important!
